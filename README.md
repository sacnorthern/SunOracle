## MVC Java SE8 Artcle by Robert Eckstein

<!-- use "ul" for indenting.. -->
<ul>The MVC article is from
[MVC with JavaSE](https://web.archive.org/web/20100801021330/http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/index-142890.html).
The archive.org article has the pictures but no source-code ZIP file.
I found source at [MVC Example](https://github.com/101companies/101repo/blob/master/technologies/Java_platform/samples/sunMvcSample/com/sun/example/mvc/)
-- right here on GitHub !!

I modified the MVC example a bit.  I found an abstract-view interface and
substituted that class: `ViewEventSink`.
Similar, the model extends `AbstractModel`.
</ul>
